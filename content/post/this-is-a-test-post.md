  Oh look, a new static website built with the Hugo Framework!
---
Current config:

* This site is generated using the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/), which generates a static HTML website using the `Paper` theme.


* The generated code is then `git pushed` to a private Github repo.
* The git repo is synced with [https://www.netlify.com/](Netlify), a CDN 
* The site code is stored in a private Github repo.
* The site is hosted using the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) platform
* a `git push` locally will cause the Netlify build pipeline to kick off, which automatically builds and deploys the latest site changes.
